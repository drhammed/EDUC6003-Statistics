Welcome to EDUC 6003 Advanced Statistics. This website will be used for all the tutorials of this course. We will be using R/RStudio throughout the semester. However, anyone interested in using Python should feel free to do so (and I'm happy to chat about that). If you're very new to R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website [R Workshop for Statistical Analysis](https://drhammed.github.io/bookdown_workshop/ "R Workshop for Statistical Analysis").

In fact, this website was built entirely using R!
