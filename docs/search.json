However, anyone interested in using Python should feel free to do so (and I‚Äôm happy to chat about that). If you‚Äôre very new to R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website R Workshop for Statistical Analysis.\nIn fact, this website was built entirely using R!"
